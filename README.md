# Webcam_Tester_and_Photo_Sharer
Simple Kivy app that allows user to test out their webcam as well as take, store and share photos


I had no simple way to test my webcam.  This program allows the user to take and share 
photos with the webcam.

It uses Python with the Kivy App library, also makes use of the Filestack service to share photos

Future upgrades:
  * A continue feature, as of now once you take a picture, you need to restart the program to take another one - [Done 5-9-2022]
  * Capture video feature, can come in handy for those wanting to shoot YouTube or Twitch videos
  * File destination feature, so user can choose where to store photos and videos
  * Possible way to operate camera controls or gimble features
  * More to be added after these are handled.
  * Functionality for multiple cameras ie. a security system or multi cam video setup.
